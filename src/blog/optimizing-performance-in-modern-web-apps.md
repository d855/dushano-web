Performance isn't just a technical concern—it directly impacts user experience, conversion rates, and even SEO rankings. Here's how I approach performance optimization in modern web applications.

## Core Web Vitals and Beyond

Google's Core Web Vitals provide a solid framework for thinking about performance:

- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Measure of loading performance
- First Input Delay (FID): Measure of interactivity
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Measure of visual stability

But don't stop there. Also consider Time to First Byte (TTFB), Time to Interactive (TTI), and Total Blocking Time (TBT) for a more complete picture.

## Asset Optimization

Modern web apps often suffer from asset bloat:

1. Implement code splitting to load only what's needed
2. Use modern image formats (WebP, AVIF) with proper sizing
3. Lazy load off-screen images and non-critical resources
4. Minify and compress all text-based assets

## Rendering Strategies

Choose the right rendering strategy for your content:

- Static Generation for content that doesn't change often
- Server-Side Rendering for dynamic content that needs SEO
- Client-Side Rendering for highly interactive applications
- Incremental Static Regeneration for the best of both worlds

## Perceived Performance

Sometimes improving actual performance isn't enough—you also need to manage perception:

- Add skeleton screens instead of spinners
- Preload critical resources
- Implement optimistic UI updates
- Use smooth animations for transitions

## Conclusion

Performance optimization is an ongoing process, not a one-time task. Establish performance budgets, measure regularly, and make optimization part of your development workflow. Small improvements add up to create significantly better user experiences.
